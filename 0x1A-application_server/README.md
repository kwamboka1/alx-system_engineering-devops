# 0x1A. Application server

![Application Server](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/projects/311)

In this project the Web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that we installed in our first web stack project. While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project we  will add this piece to our infrastructure, plug it to our Nginx and make is serve our Airbnb clone project.
